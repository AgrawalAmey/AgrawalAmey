### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a systems engineer at [Microsoft Research India](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-india/), where I work in [Dr. Muthian Sivathanu's](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/muthian/) team on low-level systems for deep learning infrastructure. Prior to that, I spent a couple of years working at [Qubole](https://www.qubole.com/), a big data platform start-up, where I built several components of the Apache Spark-based data science platform and worked on applications of machine learning for software engineering problems. I graduated with B.E. (Hons.) in Computer Science from [BITS Pilani](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/), India in 2018. For more details, refer to [my resume](https://ameya.info/docs/cv.pdf) or drop me an [email](mailto:agrawalamey12@gmail.com).
